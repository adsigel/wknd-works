## Current Pause Point
We've reached a significant milestone with the completion of the core inventory forecast visualization. The system now provides:
1. Clear visual representation of inventory trends
2. Accurate sales projections based on historical patterns
3. Meaningful threshold alerts with specific reorder recommendations
4. Integration with existing inventory and sales data

Next major tasks will focus on:
1. Testing and validation of the forecast accuracy
2. Performance optimization for large datasets
3. Enhanced features like manual restock tracking
4. User configuration options for thresholds and discounts

This is a good point to pause and gather feedback on the current implementation before proceeding with additional features.
