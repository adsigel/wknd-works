# Inventory Forecast Project Specification

## Overview
The Inventory Forecast project aims to optimize inventory purchasing timing by analyzing historical sales data and current inventory levels to predict future inventory needs. This will help reduce stockouts, minimize excess inventory, and improve cash flow.

## Current Progress
- [x] Data model design and implementation
- [x] API endpoints for forecast management
- [x] Forecast service implementation with:
  - [x] Daily sales pattern analysis
  - [x] Cross-month week handling
  - [x] Inventory threshold monitoring
  - [x] Discount factor calculations
- [x] Integration with existing inventory and sales data
- [ ] Frontend visualization components
- [ ] Testing and validation
- [ ] Production deployment

## Core Requirements

### 1. Sales Projection Model
- [x] Use historical sales data to identify patterns
- [x] Account for seasonal variations
- [x] Consider day-of-week patterns:
  - [x] Weekend days (Sat/Sun): 50% higher sales
  - [x] Mid-week (Tue-Thu): 20% higher sales
  - [x] Monday/Friday: 10% lower sales
- [x] Handle cross-month weeks correctly
- [ ] Account for special events and holidays

### 2. Inventory Level Projections
- [x] Track current inventory levels
- [x] Project future inventory levels based on sales forecasts
- [x] Calculate inventory thresholds
- [x] Monitor for potential stockouts
- [ ] Consider reorder points and lead times

### 3. Pricing Model Integration
- [x] Use actual retail prices from inventory
- [x] Apply discount factors based on inventory age
- [x] Calculate cost values
- [ ] Consider price changes and promotions

## Technical Considerations

### Data Requirements
- [x] Current inventory levels
- [x] Historical sales data
- [x] Monthly sales goals
- [x] Product pricing information
- [ ] Holiday and event calendar
- [ ] Lead time data

### Performance Requirements
- [x] Efficient data retrieval and processing
- [x] Accurate weekly projections
- [x] Real-time threshold monitoring
- [ ] Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Batch processing for large datasets

### Integration Points
- [x] Inventory management system
- [x] Sales tracking system
- [x] Pricing management
- [ ] Order management system
- [ ] Supplier management system

## Success Metrics
1. [x] Accurate weekly sales projections
2. [x] Reliable inventory level predictions
3. [x] Timely threshold alerts
4. [ ] Reduced stockout incidents
5. [ ] Improved inventory turnover
6. [ ] Better cash flow management

## Next Steps
1. Frontend Development
   - [ ] Create forecast visualization components
   - [ ] Implement interactive date range selection
   - [ ] Add threshold alert notifications
   - [ ] Design mobile-responsive layout

2. Testing
   - [ ] Unit tests for forecast calculations
   - [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
   - [ ] Performance testing for large datasets
   - [ ] User acceptance testing

3. Integration Testing
   - [ ] Test with real inventory data
   - [ ] Validate sales projections
   - [ ] Verify threshold calculations
   - [ ] Test cross-month scenarios

## Risk Assessment
1. Data Accuracy
   - [x] Implemented daily sales pattern analysis
   - [x] Added cross-month week handling
   - [ ] Need to validate historical data quality
   - [ ] Consider impact of missing data

2. System Performance
   - [x] Optimized weekly calculations
   - [x] Efficient cross-month handling
   - [ ] Monitor API response times
   - [ ] Consider caching strategies

3. User Adoption
   - [ ] Design intuitive interface
   - [ ] Provide clear documentation
   - [ ] Plan training sessions
   - [ ] Gather user feedback

## Recent Learnings
1. Sales Pattern Analysis
   - Day-of-week patterns significantly impact sales projections
   - Cross-month weeks require special handling to maintain accuracy
   - Daily sales distribution provides more accurate weekly projections

2. Technical Implementation
   - Efficient handling of cross-month scenarios improves forecast accuracy
   - Proper date handling is crucial for accurate projections
   - Threshold calculations need to consider weekly sales patterns

3. Data Integration
   - Monthly sales goals provide good baseline for projections
   - Inventory data structure supports accurate value tracking
   - Discount factors need to be applied consistently
