# TO-DO List

## UI/UX Improvements
1. Replace Month/Year picklist in the sales chart with forward/back arrows for simpler navigation
2. Move Settings button outside of the tabbed interface so it can be accessed from either tab
3. Update the copy on the stats box for "$ to Monthly Goal" to be clearer

## Chart Styling
1. Remove thickness as a styling option for the Daily Sales chart series

## Future Ideas
- Add tooltips to explain each stat in the stats box
- Consider adding a "Compare to Last Year" toggle
- Add export functionality for forecast data
- Consider adding a "Quick Actions" menu for common tasks
- Add keyboard shortcuts for navigation between tabs
